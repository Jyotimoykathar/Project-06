## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox Css

### Time required

It took me 5 hours to complete the static page.

### Continued development

I have still a lot to grab on positioning elements. Grab more knowledge at sudo classes and elements and make the page responsive.
